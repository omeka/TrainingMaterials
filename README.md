# Omeka Training Materials
A set of example lessons and materials for conducting Omeka training sessions.

## How to use the Training Materials

These files are here to provide resources and suggested lessons and topics to cover for various kinds of training in Omeka. The suggested lessons and topics are found in an "Intro" file at the top of each folder. They could be used as your out-of-the-box outline for your workshop or class, or they could just serve as your starting point for putting together your own tailored presentation. In fact, you will likely want to customize, especially as the list of lessons/topics grows.

The markdown (.md) files are the canonical files, meaning that the word processor (.odt) and PDF files are derived from them. Writing is taking place in markdown to foster ease of writing/creation without worrying too much about presentational aspect of a final outline. Again, that is because they are intended to be a list of possible things you might want to include in your presentation, and usually come from presentations that others have already done.

Additional resources -- screenshots, handouts, example files -- are also to be found in the subfolders for you to pick and choose from in creating your class or workshop. The idea here is to avoid duplicating the time and effort of creating supplemental resources for your presentation.

## Contributing to the Training Materials

You can contribute materials you have created via one of two basic paths. The first way is to simply let the Omeka team know about them by tweeting links (include @omeka in the tweet!) or posting to the forums with links. You can also use GitHub's issues system to post thoughts or links. We'll give them a look and fold them in where it seems appropriate.

The other way to contribute is to use native git and GitHub mechanisms, if you are familiar with them (this is more likely to be true of folks contributing to the plugin and theme portions of the box). Fork the repo, make additions, and send a pull request.
