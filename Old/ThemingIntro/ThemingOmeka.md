# Theming Omeka

## Default Theme Files
_Explain the default theme files in Omeka's core. These are the theme files that are used if a theme does not supply an overiding file, following the same directory path structure._


Located in
	Omeka/application/sites/views/scripts

* collections: theme files for displaying Omeka collections
* common: templates used across all theme files (like header.php and footer.php)
* css: CSS files
* error: error pages
* file: theme files for displaying files
* images: jquery-ui and other icons used when displaying images 
* items: theme files for displaying Omeka items
* javascripts: jquery and tinymce files
* upgrade: pages used during Omeka's upgrade process
* users: pages used during registration and (public) login

Most important files are usually

*	show.php -- used when displaying a single thing (collection, item, etc.)
*	browse.php -- used when displaying several of a thing
	
### Activities

* Copy the example-theme theme into your themes directory


## From Scratch Theme
_Explain how to use From Scratch to jump-start your theme development_

* Contains files and folders for collections, items, header and footer, css, and more to get you up and theming quickly.

### Activities

* Download From Scratch and look through style.css

## Override the items/show page

_Demonstrate the typical functions, CSS classes, and structures used in a show page_

[Functions](http://omeka.org/codex/Functions)

* __() : translates text. Best not to change the text, as translations will break!
* head() : data passed to the header.php file for display
* get_current_item() : makes sure there is an item for item() to work on
* item() : displays element set data
* custom_show_item_metadata() : in defaults--can't override! shows ALL the metadata

### Changes coming in Omeka 2.0 (Fall 2012)

* custom_show_item_metadata() will go away. Unsure what, if anything, will replace it (May 20, 2012)

### Activities

* Move the pagination links to the top of the page
* Highlight the item description by putting it prominently under the title
* Customize the metadata shown by getting rid of custom_show_item_metadata (some themes let you do this in their configuration settings)

## Override the items/browse page

_Demonstrate the typical functions, CSS classes, and structures used in a browse page_

Copy items/browse into example-theme

* loop_items() : used in a <?php while(); ?> structure to loop through items
* item_tags_as_string() : echo out the tags
* item_has_tags() : checks if an item has tags using a  <?php if(): ?> structure
* link_to_item() : creates a link to the current item
* custom_nav_items()

### Omeka's loop record structure

_Explain Omeka's looping of records (similar to WordPress')_


### Activities

* Add an additional metadata field (e.g., identifier) to the display for each item
* Add navigation links to Home by getting rid of the call to custom_nav_items()

## Override the header/footer

_Demonstrate the typical functions, CSS classes, and structures used in header and footer_

* settings() : get settings set in the site configuration
* queue_css() : use before display_css() to queue CSS files to be added
* queue_js() : use before display_js() to queue javascript files to be added

### Activities

* Add in new stylesheet
* Add in a new javascript file

## Override the front page

## Plugin hooks

_Explain the plugin hook system, and why it is important for themers_

[Hooks](http://omeka.org/codex/Hooks)

Functions beginning with plugin_ provide mechanisms for plugins to add content to pages. Not including theme in your theme may cause plugins to lose functionality. Usually, it is safe to move them around though.

Hook public_theme_header() is fired by plugin_theme_header() in the theme. Similarly for all hooks.


## Theme Configuration

_Explain the config.ini file, and how to retrieve settings made there in your themes_

Omeka has a robust mechanism for theme designers to easily create a configuration page for your themes. This happens via a config.ini file for the theme, and by calling get_theme_option() appropriately in your theme files.

### config.ini file and the theme config page

//screenshots of theme config page and the file

The theme config.ini page lets you give instructions to Omeka about how to put together the theme config page. For each option that you want to create, it needs:

* input type
* label
* description
* optional settings specific to the input type
* optional validation settings

When using get_theme_option(), logo in config.ini becomes get_theme_option('Logo'). background_header becomes get_theme_option('Background Header')

### Activities

* Add a configuration option to change the color to use for item titles
* Add configuration option to highlight the description of an item (see items/show page activities)


## Overriding plugin views
_Explain how to look through plugin files and override their views_

* Plugins have a 'views/public' (or 'views/shared') folder that contains the views (pages) they generate. You can override those the same way you override the core views. Copy the first folder under 'public' or 'shared' to your theme

### Activities

* Install SimplePages and hack the public/show page to alter the title


## Using head() function to customize different pages

_Contributed by Michael Tedeschi, Interactive Mechanics_

On your content pages (index.php, show.php, etc) at the top of your document you can include the following code to change the `<body>` tag and `<head>` information:


    <?php head(array(
        'title' => ‘My Page Title’,
        'bodyid' => 'MyPageID',
        'bodyclass'=>'className01 classname02'
      )); 
    ?>


'title' controls the `<title>` tag, allowing for a custom name for the page
'bodyid' and 'bodyclass' add custom classes to the `<body>` tag, allowing for custom control of individual page templates
 
## Adding custom styling with head() by page/exhibit slug

_Contributed by Michael Tedeschi, Interactive Mechanics_


    <?php head(array(
        'title' => html_escape(exhibit('title') . ' : '. exhibit_page('title')),
        'bodyid'=>'exhibit',
        'bodyclass' => html_escape(exhibit('slug') . ' show')
    )); 
    ?>


Omeka has functions to pull the current page information—for this example, we’re on an exhibit page. For the title, we’re using exhibit(‘title’) to pull the human-readable name of the current exhibit. exhibit_page(‘title’) grabs the name of the current page in the exhibit. exhibit(‘slug’) grabs the machine readable name of the exhibit—for example, “This Omeka Exhibit” might have a slug of “this-omeka-exhibit” made safe for web.


## Customizing Plugin Views

_Contributed by Michael Tedeschi, Interactive Mechanics_

Each plugin has their own set of “Views,” or templates controlling layout and appearance for the theme. These files can be included in your theme to overwrite styling and layout.
[omeka-base-directory] > plugins > [plugin-name] > Views > Public >
Inside of the Public folder is the folder(s) containing all page views. In your theme directory, create a folder for the slug of the plugin (e.g. “Simple Pages” would be “simple-pages”, “Exhibit Builder” would be “exhibit-builder”) and copy the folders and files in the Public directory into this new directory.
