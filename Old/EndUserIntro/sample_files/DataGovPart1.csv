And as we expand the initiative we are also expanding our goal.  Moving forward, the government’s goal will be to close at least 40% of identified data centers, consistent with our original consolidation goal.  That means we’ll be looking to consolidate at least 1200 data centers by the end of 2015 – a goal that requires us to continue aggressively rooting out duplication and waste in our expanded baseline of 3,133 data centers.  This update also reflects a shift from calendar year to fiscal year reporting. 
 
This dataset reflects information provided by the agencies. All questions or inquiries should be directed to the specific agencies. The FY2010 through FY2012 dataset provides a list of planned or closed data centers by agency and by city/state location since the FDCCI started in February 2010. The Data Center Consolidation Task Force meets monthly to review the progress of each consolidation project and ensure government-wide alignment among agency efforts, where appropriate. The Task Force comprises data center program managers, facilities managers, and sustainability officers from 24 agencies that work together to share progress toward individual agency goals.  As its work evolves, the Task Force will serve as a ""community of practice"" for agency CIOs and data center program managers to share best practices and enhance consolidation effectiveness.

The NCVS was designed with four primary objectives: (1) to develop detailed information about the victims and consequences of crime, (2) to estimate the number and types of crimes both reported and not reported to the police, (3) to provide uniform measures of selected types of crimes, and (4) to permit comparisons over time and types of areas. The survey categorizes crimes as ""personal"" or ""property."" Personal crimes include rape and sexual assault, robbery, aggravated and simple assault, and purse-snatching/pocket-picking, while property crimes include burglary, theft, motor vehicle theft, and vandalism. Each respondent is asked a series of screen questions designed to determine whether she or he was victimized during the six-month period preceding the interview. A ""household respondent"" is also asked to report on crimes against the household as a whole (e.g., burglary, motor vehicle theft). The data include type of crime, month, time, and location of the crime, relationship between victim and offender, characteristics of the offender, self-protective actions taken by the victim during the incident and results of those actions, consequences of the victimization, type of property lost, whether the crime was reported to police and reasons for reporting or not reporting, and offender use of weapons, drugs, and alcohol. Basic demographic information such as age, race, gender, and income is also collected, to enable analysis of crime against various subpopulations.","Law Enforcement, Courts, and Prisons","theft, violent crimen, intimate partner violence, crime costs, crime rates, offenses, offenders, motor vehicle theft, victimization, crime, crime statistics, rape, property crimes, crime reporting, robbery, burglary, reactions to crime, assault, sexual offenses",0,0,rfme-ynch,Annual,2008,Department of Justice,Bureau of Justice Statistics,N,N,Raw Data Catalog,rfme-ynch,,,,1526

Terra's orbit around the Earth is timed so that it passes from north to south across the equator in the morning, while Aqua passes south to north over the equator in the afternoon. Terra MODIS and Aqua MODIS are viewing the entire Earth's surface every 1 to 2 days, acquiring data in 36 spectral bands, or groups of wavelengths (see MODIS Technical Specifications). This map shows the temperature of Earth's lands during the nighttime. Temperature is a measure of how warm or cold an object is. During the day, the Sun's rays warm Earth's lands. At night, the lands typically cool off. Landscapes cool off at night because they release their warmth to air above while they are no longer receiving sunlight. Scientists can measure the temperature of Earth's lands from space using instruments carried on satellites. Scientists want to know the land's temperature for many important reasons. For example, in places where it is too hot or too cold food crops may die. Temperature also influences weather and climate patterns. So, mapping the temperature of Earth's lands helps scientists to better understand our world.  The colors on these maps represent temperature patterns of the top millimeter (or skin) of the land surface including bare land, snow or ice cover, urban areas, and cropland or forest canopy as observed by MODIS in clear-sky conditions for the time period indicated. Yellow shows the warmest temperatures (up to 45°C) and light blue shows the coldest temperatures (down to -25°C).

The annual Federal Fleet Report publishes motor vehicle fleet inventory, cost, and use data from these annual submissions, and the resulting data tables are available in these datasets.   While GSA is working to improve the quality and reliability of the Federal Fleet Report, some categories contained within the Report are undefined or unclear, and the data is susceptible to coding errors, flaws and omissions.   For example, the term ""limousine"" is not defined.  Vehicles represented as limousines can range from protective duty vehicles to common sedans, and many of these vehicles serve in a law enforcement or protective capacity.  Additionally, the Fleet Report acquisition data reflects vehicles that were delivered during the fiscal year, not vehicles that were ordered.  For example, vehicles noted in the Fiscal Year 2009 Fleet Report would have been funded and ordered in Fiscal Year 2008.  The May 2011 Presidential Memorandum on Federal Fleet Performance directs GSA to work with agencies to improve Federal fleet performance, including motor vehicle data.  GSA looks forward to implementing improvements to ensure the accuracy and completeness of agency motor vehicle inventories and data systems.  This data is vital for agencies to right-size their fleet, and can serve as a useful tool to help agencies achieve cost and energy savings as directed by the Presidential Memorandum.",Transportation,"FAST, fleet utilization, vehicle inventory, fleet cost, fleet report, federal fleet, motor vehicles, fleet inventory, FAST report, federal fleet report, motor vehicle fleet, vehicle utilization, vehicle cost",0,0,i39u-zs58,Annual,Fiscal year,General Services Administration,Office of Governmentwide Policy,N,N,Raw Data Catalog,i39u-zs58,,,,1969

It was implemented to improve the availability of data needed for improving vehicle safety performance and reducing deaths related to vehicles in transport. The Agency's goal is to reduce fatal injuries resulting from motor vehicle crashes to a rate of 1.0 fatalities per 100M VMT from the current rate of 1.5. It is the only national census data system for fatal vehicle crashes. FARS is extensively referenced to support legislation, enforcement and education programs designed to reduce injury and property damage resulting from motor vehicle crashes. The FARS data are used by virtually all traffic safety professionals and other customers interested in traffic safety including: Congress, NHTSA, USDOT, State agencies, the automotive industry, the insurance industry, advocacy groups, international users, and the general public. The FARS data support customers' most significant programs that address traffic safety. It is the basis for the Agency's traffic safety grants to the States for programs such as the Impaired Driver Program. FARS collects State level data for analysis of traffic safety crashes to identify problems and evaluate countermeasures designed to reduce injuries and property damage resulting from motor vehicle crashes. The data are used for agency rulemaking and targeting grant money to areas most in need. The types of data collected can be used specifically to conduct research on ways to remediate problems such as alcohol involvement, vehicle types, weather and road conditions, seat belt use, car seats, air bags. The program provides analytical data and information to the public through various media, including the program's web services. The program is able to target data collections to respond to the most recent Congressional interest and mandates for new data. The Information Technology component provides for support for operations and maintenance of the program's data collection application, client server platform, and communications network that is consistent with the Agency's architecture and standards. Without the FARS program and data, many of the legislative actions, enforcement, and education programs designed to save lives and reduce traffic safety related injuries and property damage could not be targeted, affected, or enacted.","Births, Deaths, Marriages, and Divorces","fatal vehicle crashes, fatality analysis  traffic safety",0,0,gjf3-c985,real-time ( when cases happen),real-time ( when cases happen),Department of Transportation,National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,N,N,Tool Catalog,gjf3-c985,,,,457

The 2006 Census of Jail Facilities gathered data from all jail detention facilities holding inmates beyond arraignment, a period normally exceeding 72 hours. Jail facilities were operated by cities and counties, by private entities under contract to correctional authorities, and by the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP). Excluded from the census were physically separate temporary holding facilities such as drunk tanks and police lockups that do not hold persons after being formally charged in court. Also excluded were state-operated facilities in Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Alaska, which have combined jail-prison systems.

My HealtheVet is intended to improve the delivery of health care services to Veterans, to promote health and wellness, and to engage Veterans as more active participants in their health care. The My HealtheVet portal enables Veterans to create and maintain a web-based PHR that provides access to patient health education information and resources, a comprehensive personal health journal, and electronic services such as online VA prescription refill requests and secure messaging. Copies of key portions of the VA Electronic Health Record (EHR) are being added to the PHR incrementally. Veterans can visit the My HealtheVet website and self-register to create an account, although registration is not required to view the professionally-sponsored health education resources, including topics of special interest to the Veteran population. Once registered, Veterans can create a customized PHR that is accessible from any computer with Internet access. For Veterans who are VA patients, a one-time identity verification process of In Person Authentication (IPA) at a local VA facility provides access to additional features, such as the ability to import extracted VA EHR data to create a complete summary of both VA medications and the patient's self-entered prescriptions, over the counter medications, herbals, and supplements. The site also includes a customizable health calendar, online learning modules, and self-assessment tools. ""The BlueButton"" project, a partnership between the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and VA enable Veterans to test their computer's ability to download their health care information in a simple file format, which can then be uploaded into a unique Personal Health Record application of their choice.

EPA's ToxCast program aims to address these concerns by screening and prioritizing chemicals for potential human toxicity using in vitro assays and in silico approaches.  Objectives: This project aims to evaluate the use of in vitro assays for understanding the types of molecular and pathway perturbations caused by environmental chemicals and to build initial prioritization models of in vivo toxicity.   Methods: We tested 309 mostly pesticide active chemicals in 467 assays across 9 technologies, including high-throughput cell-free assays and cell-based assays in multiple human primary cells and cell lines, plus rat primary hepatocytes. Both individual and composite scores for effects on genes and pathways were analyzed.   Results: Chemicals display a broad spectrum of activity at the molecular and pathway levels. Many expected interactions are seen, including endocrine and xenobiotic metabolism enzyme activity. Chemicals range in promiscuity across pathways, from no activity to affecting dozens of pathways. We find a statistically significant inverse association between the number of pathways perturbed by a chemical at low in vitro concentrations and the lowest in vivo dose at which a chemical causes toxicity. We also find associations between a small set in vitro assays and rodent liver lesion formation.  Conclusions: This approach promises to provide meaningful data on the thousands of untested environmental chemicals, and to guide targeted testing of environmental contaminants.",Science and Technology,"pesticide, Toxicology, ToxCast, pollutant, environment, contaminant, chemical, prioritization, toxic, pollution, cancer, compound, In vitro screening, test, toxicity, Tox21",0,0,6k64-ygzz,NA,NA,Environmental Protection Agency,,Y,N,Raw Data Catalog,6k64-ygzz,,,,1336

The annual Federal Fleet Report publishes motor vehicle fleet inventory, cost, and use data from these annual submissions, and the resulting data tables are available in these datasets.   While GSA is working to improve the quality and reliability of the Federal Fleet Report, some categories contained within the Report are undefined or unclear, and the data is susceptible to coding errors, flaws and omissions.   For example, the term ""limousine"" is not defined.  Vehicles represented as limousines can range from protective duty vehicles to common sedans, and many of these vehicles serve in a law enforcement or protective capacity.  Additionally, the Fleet Report acquisition data reflects vehicles that were delivered during the fiscal year, not vehicles that were ordered.  For example, vehicles noted in the Fiscal Year 2009 Fleet Report would have been funded and ordered in Fiscal Year 2008.

The values of total fails-to-deliver shares represent the aggregate net balance of shares that failed to be delivered as of a particular settlement date. Fails to deliver on a given day are a cumulative number of all fails outstanding until that day, plus new fails that occur that day, less fails that settle that day. The figure is not a daily amount of fails, but a combined figure that includes both new fails on the reporting day as well as existing fails. In other words, these numbers reflect aggregate fails as of a specific point in time, and may have little or no relationship to yesterday's aggregate fails. Thus, it is important to note that the age of fails cannot be determined by looking at these numbers.

The Visible Human Project has its roots in the Library's 1986 Long-Range Plan. The plan recommended that NLM should ""...thoroughly and systematically investigate the technical requirements for and feasibility of instituting a biomedical images library."" It encouraged the NLM to consider building and disseminating medical image libraries much the same way it acquires, indexes, and provides access to the biomedical literature. It foresaw a coming era where NLM's bibliographic and factual database services would be complemented by libraries of digital images, distributed over high-speed computer networks and by high-capacity physical media. Not surprisingly, it saw an increasing role for electronically represented images in clinical medicine and biomedical research. Early in 1989, under the direction of the Board of Regents, an adhoc planning panel was convened to explore the proper role for NLM in the rapidly changing field of electronic imaging. After much deliberation, the NLM Planning Panel on Electronic Image Libraries made the following recommendation: ""NLM should undertake a first project building a digital image library of volumetric data representing a complete, normal adult male and female.  This Visible Human Project will include digitized photographic images for cryosectioning, digital images derived from computerized tomography and digital magnetic resonance images of cadavers."" The Visible Human Project is acquiring images from representative male and female cadavers.
