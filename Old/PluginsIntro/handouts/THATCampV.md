# THATCamp Prime the Fifth Omeka Plugin Workshop

## Simplest plugin -- Using Hooks and Filters
(15 min)

_Overview of hooks and filters in Omeka_

We'll append text to an items show page, and add a new tab to the items edit page.

* Install HookFilterExample plugin
* The `Omeka_Plugin_Abstract` class (new in 1.5)
** Compare to pre-1.5 style function calls
* Difference between a hook and a filter

### Activities

* Change the text displayed in the hook
* Follow the same pattern to alter collection pages


## Models
(15 min)

_How Models work in Omeka_

We'll work with the skeleton of a plugin that records additional information of collectors for collections.

* Install ModelExample plugin

* Describing your model to Omeka: `models/Collector.php`
* Setting up the database table with the `install` hook
* Creating and saving records
	* Faking it in the install hook
* `/models/Collector.php` vs `models/CollectorTable.php`
	* `get_db()->getTable('Collector');`
* `/application/libraries/Omeka/Db/Table.php`
* `/application/libraries/Omeka/Record.php`

### Activities

* Change the plugin to use the Omeka pattern of `findBy()`
* Fix the bug! Non-public Collectors still show up on the public page
	* Add a filter for public in CollectorTable and alter the hook to use it.
* Add the same data to the admin show page

## Controllers and Views
(20 min)

_How Controllers and Views work with URL paths_

We'll work with a plugin skeleton that creates a new URL path to display data

* Install ControllerViewsExample plugin

* What a Controller does
	* Grabs data about a Model from database and make it available to a view
	* based on an Action
	* `controller/action` URL paths
* shared, public, and admin directories and URL paths
* `index` is automatic Controller in Zend
* watch things break at other URLS!
* `application/libraries/Omeka/Controller/Action.php`

### Demo

* create some data in a variable in the indexAction and display it in the view

### Activities

* create some data in a variable in the indexController and display it in the view
* create a new view and action at a different URL
* create different admin and public views

## Putting it all together with Omeka defaults

Take all that we've learned, and add controllers and views for the ModelExample plugin.

Omeka has browse, show, edit, delete Actions

1. Create a Controller and a View to display information about each Collector
1. Set the default 'scaffolding' class in init() method
1. Build the `show` view for the public side
1. Build a `browse` page for Collectors


### Extra bonus activities, probably as exercises for after our session

* Build an `add` and `edit` page for the admin side to add Collectors, and add them to a Collection. Bonus points if you use existing user and/or collector data
* Add form to the Collection add and edit pages, using the appropriate hooks, to add or remove existing Collectors to the Collection

## Further exploration

* Explore more hooks and filters
* Look at examples of using pagination in browse views in other plugins
* Play with the implied hooks, e.g. `hook_after_save_item` to do things when an item is saved
* Explore ACL and permissions
