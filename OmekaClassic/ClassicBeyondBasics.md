[How to get more out of your Omeka install - a workshop for no-longer
beginners]{.ul}

Yes, plugins, and we'll get there, but first some thing that's more
intangible

Thinking through your site:

-   Item-level information vs. exhibit info

-   Even if your focus is building exhibits, people will end up clicking
    > through to the item. There should be *something* there for them.

    -   Example: how we thought about items on HNM in their own desc vs
        > the exhibit info.

-   What information do you want to capture and what elements exist that
    > can help you do that? Is there something you might need a plugin
    > for (like geolocation)?

-   Thing about organization

    -   Collections

    -   Tags

    -   Exhibits

    -   Information architecture - what are you including on the
        > navigation and why. What are you omitting and why?

    -   Page layout - different themes put the images at the top or the
        > bottom. What do you want to forefront?

Things that are part of the Core and will improve your workflow

-   Increase the number of results on the browse page of your admin
    > side:

    -   Appearance - Settings: change the results per page on the admin
        > side.

    -   Gives you more to work with, less clicking through when browsing
        > items, exhibits.

-   Manage your Element Sets

    -   Move:

        -   you can rearrange so the one's

    -   Comment

        -   Finally worked out how you're using Coverage? Want to
            > remember your decision in 3 months? Don't write it down on
            > a sticky note, put it in your install!

    -   This is helpful for notes to self, but also for collaborative
        > Omeka sites, so that everyone knows what format of date to
        > use, etc.

    -   Might also be helpful in teaching or volunteer situations, to
        > provide guidance.

Plugins for Controlled Vocabulary:

First: what *is* a controlled vocabulary and why might you want to use
one?

-   Getty and LoC suggest link up a field or fields with the vocabs from
    > the Getty and LoC

    -   you do need to know how their terminology works for these to be
        > useful,

    -   But it's handy if you wanted to (for example) use LoC subject
        > classifications in Subject or Getty Place Name thesaurus for
        > coverage

-   SimpleVocab

    -   Pick an element, create a dropdown list

    -   You control the vocabulary

    -   Useful for small sets

-   Search by Metadata

    -   Makes the text in elements searchable BUT they must be an exact
        > match

    -   Use with SimpleVocab to ensure consistency

Collecting from the Community

-   Add the Simple Contact form and/or set up an email just for the
    > account

-   Using Contribution

    -   Guest User usually required (people can create an
        > admin-side-only account, log in to contribute multiple items)
        > but:

    -   New superanon options in version 3.1 - users can contribute
        > completely anonymously without creating a guest account

        -   Why you might or might not want to do this

-   User Profiles - do you anticipate collecting multiple items from a
    > key set of individuals? Do you want to collect information about
    > them? (this is, in some ways, the other end of the spectrum from
    > the superanonymous options.

Redact Elements

-   you're going to need figure out how to use RegEx, but you can
    > protect specific pieces of data

-   Make visible by different user levels

-   Does not protect user data, only item data, but you could use it in
    > conjunction with contribution fields to protect specific data.

Analysing what you have:

-   Text Analysis and NGram
